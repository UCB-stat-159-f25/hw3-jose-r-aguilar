Using Chat-GPT: 

Prompt: Create a Makefile 

There should be a Makefile with the following targets. env: creates and configures the environment (but does not activate it). If you have already created an environment of the same name, have the command instead update the environment with a provided environment.yml file html: build the html rendering of your MyST site (i.e. what’s produced when you call myst build --html on the command line). Note this build can only be viewed locally. clean: clean up the figures, audio and _build folders, but keep folders.

Output: 

ENV_NAME ?= stat259
ENV_FILE ?= environment.yml


.PHONY: env html clean

env:
	@source $(CONDA_BASE)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
	if conda env list | awk '{print $$1}' | grep -qx "$(ENV_NAME)"; then
		echo "Updating existing environment: $(ENV_NAME)"
		conda env update -n $(ENV_NAME) -f $(ENV_FILE) --prune
	else
		echo "Creating new environment: $(ENV_NAME)"
		conda env create -n $(ENV_NAME) -f $(ENV_FILE)
	fi

html:
	myst build --html

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning contents of figures/, audio/, and _build/ (keeping folders)..."
	@mkdir -p figures audio _build
	rm -rf figures/* audio/* _build/*
	@echo "✅ Clean complete."
